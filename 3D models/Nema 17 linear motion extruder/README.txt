Nema 17 linear motion extruder by craftedkwads on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4559933

Summary:
This is a linear motion extruder for printers that utilize Nema 17 motors and its mounting pattern. It has tight tolerances so that flexible filaments can be used without getting jammed or twisting. The linear motion of the bearing removes any possibility of the lever arm cracking, and can have variable tension, as the extruder can accept many sizes of springs with different forces. The extruder body is designed for use of a captive nut to hold in the ptfe coupler, as I have experienced couplers getting pulled out of the extruder when using fully 3d printed extruders. This extruder is perfectly aligned for the E3D Hobb Goblin extruder gear and a 624zz bearing. Other combinations may work, but know that it wont be aligned correctly and would quite likely have diminished performance as a result. I'm using these bowden couplings: https://www.robotdigg.com/product/348/Heavy-duty-push-fit-bowden-connector-4-01 which the TPU coupling stay is designed for. most m5 bowden fittings should fit but some may be unsuitable.
